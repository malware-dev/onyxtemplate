v.1.3.2-alpha
 - Forgot to replace .Any() with .Count > 0 when changing from IEnumerable to IReadOnlyList
 - Collection item names used the variable name instead of the collection name, breaking backwards compatibility.

v.1.3.1-alpha
 - I stupidly had implicit usings in my test project, which meant that code that shouldn't have compiled, compiled. Fixed that.

v.1.3.0-alpha
 - Complete rewrite of the generator to handle _so_ many bugs...
 - Breaking change: Lists are no longer IEnumerable, they are now IReadOnlyList to support indexing and count without evaluating the list multiple times.
 - Added meta-macro support: You can now reference items in a scope higher up by prefixing fields with a period. Example: {{ .Name }} will reference the Name field in the parent scope, and {{ $if .$first }} will check if the current item is in the first item in the parent scope. You can add multiple periods to reference higher scopes. 

v.1.2.1-alpha
 - Missing a using...

v.1.2.0-alpha
 - BREAKING CHANGE: Completely changed the way the template is generated and used code wise, to simplify even further.
 - Should now support environments with nullable support a little better.

v.1.1.7-alpha
 - Learned how to include release notes!

v.1.1.6-alpha
 - Added "not" support to conditionals
 - Now supports item states {{ $if <state> }} where <state> can be $first $last $middle $odd $even
 - Fixed bad end check, fixed bad location of Else macro type check
 - Fixed a rather ugly infinite loop
